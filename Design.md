## OSIS inital setup

For the initial installation of OSIS application, following steps must be executed.
1. A **Super Admin** account will be created as part of S3C/Vault setup
1. Set OSE properties:
   1. S3 URL
   1. Admin Vault URL along with credentials as Super Admin access key/ secret key
    
_**Note: "Super Admin" account has full Account Management access and can use "AssumeRoleBackbeat" to assume a role of another Account.**_

## Tenant APIs
<u>**Important Assumptions:**</u>
* All the Tenant APIs on OSIS will use **Super Admin credentials** to manage on Vault.
* A Vault Account is equivalent of OSE Tenant.

### Create Tenant
This API creates a Tenant on Vault.  
1. Vault `create-account` api will be called using vaultclient. 
    * Tenant Name is stored as Account Name  
    * `cd_tenant_ids` list as part of the request to be stored as a property of the vault account.
    * Account ID to be sent back as storage tenant ID to OSE
1. `generate-account-access-key` for the account using vaultclient.
1. Create a role using generated access key with
   1. Role name : `osis` (So role-arn can be generated in the format `arn:aws:iam::[account-id]:role/osis`
   1. Trust policy
   ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [{
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "service-name"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
            }]
    }
   ```
1. `attach-role-policy` with s3 and iam full access to this role using generated access key
1. `delete-access-key` for the account.

### Create Tenant Example Activity Diagram
![Create Tenant](Design_Files/OSE-OSIS-Create-Tenant.png)

### List Tenants
This API will list tenants on Vault. 

* `List Tenants` API can be called with following parameters:
    * `offset`:  The start index of tenants to return (optional)
    * `limit`: Maximum number of tenants to return (optional)

* Vault `list-accounts` api will be called using vaultclient with parameters
   1. `marker` (if exists from `markerCache`)
   1. `max-limit`
   1.  `filterKeyStartsWith=cd_tenant_id` (Only return the accounts with at least one `cd_tenant_id`)

* <u>`markerCache`</u>
    * Every time `List Accounts` API is called by the OSIS, if `isTruncated` is `true` in the response, then `marker` value will be stored in the `markerCache` with the key as `(max-limit +1)`
    * Each entry in the `markerCache` will be short-lived (implement may be only with 60 seconds)

### Query Tenants
This API will query tenants on Vault using a `filter` parameter.

1. `Query Tenants` API can be called with following parameters:
    * `offset`:  The start index of tenants to return (optional)
    * `limit`: Maximum number of tenants to return (optional)
    * `filter` parameter
        * Usually the OSE passes only the `cd_tenant_id` field with a value under `filter` parameter
    
1. Vault `list-accounts` api will be called using vaultclient with parameters
    1. `marker` (if exists from `markerCache`)
    1. `max-limit`
    1.  `filterKey=cd_tenant_id%3D%3D<uuid1>` (Always the `filter` value from OSE will be in the format of `cd_tenant_id%3D%3D<uuid1>`)


### Get Tenant
This API will return the tenant on Vault with `tenantID`.
1. Vault `get-account` api will be called using vaultclient with the provided `tenantID` as `AccountID`.

### Head Tenant
This API will check whether the tenant exists on Vault with `tenantID`.
1. Vault `get-account` api will be called using vaultclient with the provided `tenantID` as `AccountID`.
1. Return `true` or `false` if result is returned or not respectively.

### Delete Tenant
This API will delete the tenant on Vault. 

1. Vault `delete-account` api will be called using vaultclient with the provided `tenantID` as `AccountID`.
1. Return error if account is not empty.

### Update Tenant
This API will update the existing storage tenant with the provided `cd_tenant_id`. Input parameters are:
* `tenantId`:   Tenant ID of the tenant to update
* `tenant` object: Object that holds the new `cd_tenant_ids` along with original `tenant` properties.

1. Vault `update-account` api will be called using vaultclient with the provided `tenantID` as `AccountID` and `tenant` properties

## User APIs

### Assume Role behavior for all User APIs
* Use the tenant account credentials from the `assumeRoleCache` cache for the given account ID before each User API.
* If the tenant account credentials were not found in `assumeRoleCache`, `AssumeRoleBackbeat` api needs to be called as Super Admin 
* `assumeRoleCache` cache will be key-value pair of account_id and temporary credentials object respectively.
    * `assumeRoleCache` cache will have TTL.
    * Refresh the credentials periodically on the cache (AWS SDK `refresh()` will be used)
    * _[ A detailed cache design needs to be added ]_

### Create User
This API creates a user on Vault.
1. `create-user` api will be called using assumed role credentials.
    * `cd_user_id` is stored as username.
1. `attach-policy` for the new user will be called using the assumed role credentials with full S3 and IAM access permissions.
1. `create-s3credentials` api will be called using assumed role credentials

### Create User Example Activity Diagram
![Create User](Design_Files/OSE-OSIS-Create-User.png)

### Query Users
This API will query users on Vault using a `filter` parameter.
1. `list-users` api will be called using assumed role credentials.
1. Filter the result users using the `filter` parameter in the request

### List Users
This API will list users on Vault.
1. `list-users` api will be called using assumed role credentials.

### Get User w/ userid
This API will return the user.
1. `get-user` api will be called using assumed role credentials with cd_user_id as username.

### Get User w/ canonical ID
This API will return the user.
1. `get-user` api will be called using assumed role credentials with canonical_id as canonical_user_id?

### Head User
This API will return if user exists or not.
1. `get-user` api will be called using assumed role credentials with cd_user_id as username.
1. Return `true` or `false` if result is returned or not respectively.

### Delete User
This API will delete user on Vault.
1. `delete-user` api will be called using assumed role credentials.

### Update User
This API will enable or disable user on Vault.
1. `updateAccessKey` api will be called using assumed role credentials to disable/enable access keys for the user.

## S3 Credential APIs
### Common behavior for all S3 Credential APIs will be same as User APIs ([check here](#Assume-Role-behavior-for-all-User-APIs))


### Create S3 Credential
This API creates S3 credential for the user.
1. `generate-access-key` api will be called using assumed role credentials.

### Query S3 Credentials
This API query S3 credentials of the  user using a `filter` parameter.
1. `list-access-keys` api will be called using assumed role credentials.
1. Filter the result credentials using the `filter` parameter in the request.

### List S3 Credentials
This API list S3 credentials of the  user.
1. `list-access-keys` api will be called using assumed role credentials.

### Delete S3 Credential
This API deletes the S3 credential of the user.
1. `delete-access-key` api will be called using assumed role credentials.

### Get S3 Credential
This API return S3 credential of the user.
1. `get-access-key` api will be called using assumed role credentials.

## Miscellaneous APIs:

### getProviderConsoleUrl
Get the console URI of the platform or platform tenant if tenantId is specified
* Return supervisor URL (Static and needs to be maintained in Config)
* This is a tunable

### getTenantConsoleUrl 
Get the console URI of the platform or platform tenant if tenantId is specified
1. First iteration
    1. It is configuration in application.yml
    1. It is Url of the S3 console

1. Optional: we can provide some kind of SSO)
1. For Next Gen production, it will be the XDM ui

### getS3Capabilities 
Get S3 capabilities of the platform
* It is using an xml file to show s3 capabilities itâ€™s a copy paste from ceph code)

### getInformation
Get the information of the REST Services, including platform name, OSIS version and etc (Static Details)
1. First Version, Make all information configuration except the usage part
1. Next Gen, Implement the usage tenant level part with UTAPIv2 (write -java utapi-client)

### updateOsisCaps (?)

### getBucketList
Get the bucket list of the platform tenant
* S3:`listBucket` API
### getOsisUsage 
Get the platform usage of global (without query parameter), tenant (with tenant_id) or user (only with user_id).
1. We donâ€™t know yet what needs to be done here
1. For next generation,
    1. Utapi Service level -> global platform
    1. Utapi Account level -> tenant level
    1. Utapi User level -> user level
